For compiling under windows you need to do the following:
1. Install AVR GNU Toolchain from Atmel
2. Install Cygwin for sh.exe (base installation is sufficient)
3. Add the bin path of cygwin (containing sh.exe) to the PATH environment variable for MAKE to find it

Then you should be good to go to build the firmware by typing in the following:
> make
