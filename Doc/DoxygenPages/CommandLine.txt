/** @page Page_CommandLine The Chameleon Command Structure
 * After plugging in a USB cable, the ChameleonMini enumerates as a virtual serial interface.
 * The settings of the serial interface, e.g. baudrate, stop and parity bits, are ignored by the Chameleon.
 * For a high level of compatibility towards both humans and computers, Chameleon can be set up and controlled by means of a 
 * text-based command line interface, which can be accessed by using
 * simple terminal software like hyper-terminal or teraterm. The command line is optimized to cooperate with script languages such as Python or TCL. 
 *
 * \note Before reading this page, you may also wish to have a look at the [Chameleon Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxieds.chameleonminilivedebugger), which is an external contribution to this project. Development and maintenance can be found [here](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger) (please also ask questions regarding the app there).
 *
 * Chameleon Command Structure
 * ===========================
 * For communicating with the Chameleon via USB, there exist four different syntax types:
 * - `<COMMAND>=<VALUE>` sets a parameter of the Chameleon ('set')
 * - `<COMMAND>=?` lists all possible values for the parameter ('suggest')
 * - `<COMMAND>?` returns the current value of a parameter ('get') 
 * - `<COMMAND>` Executes a function with an optional response ('execute') 
 * 
 * For example, `CONFIG=?` lists the available types of virtualized cards and other options to configure a slot, while `CONFIG=MF_CLASSIC_1K` sets the current slot to Mifare Classic 1k emulation. In consequence, `CONFIG?` will return MF_CLASSIC_1K. Examples for commands executing a function are CLEAR, RESET or UPLOAD.
 *
 * The responses of Chameleon indicate whether an action was successful or whether (and why) an error occurred. Examples: In case of an invalid command, the Chameleon replies with `200:UNKNOWN COMMAND`. In case of a known command, but a wrong syntax, the Chameleon replies with `201:INVALID COMMAND USAGE`.
 *
 * Note: Each command has to be followed by a carriage return (CR, 0D hexadecimal). The backspace (08 hexadecimal) and escape (1B hexadecimal) keys are supported. All other control characters of the ASCII character set are ignored. The Chameleon commands are not case-sensitive. There is no echo of entered characters by the Chameleon, thus remember to switch on the 'local echo' in your terminal program.
 * 
 * Responses
 * ---------
 * Subsequent to any command sent, the Chameleon responds with a status number and a corresponding status message, separated by a colon and terminated with a carriage return and line feed (CR+LF, 0D+0A hexadecimal). Status numbers are of a three-digit decimal format with the first digit showing the severity of the answer. Status numbers beginning with a '1' denote an informational item and those beginning with a '2' denote an error.
 * Response                     | Description
 * ---------------------------- | -----------
 * `100:OK`                     | The command has been successfully executed
 * `101:OK WITH TEXT`           | The command has been successfully executed and this response is appended with an additional line of information, terminated with CR+LF
 * `110:WAITING FOR XMODEM`     | The Chameleon is waiting for an XMODEM connection to be established
 * `120:FALSE`                  | The request is answered with false
 * `121:TRUE`                   | The request is answered with true
 * `200:UNKNOWN COMMAND`        | This command is unknown to the Chameleon
 * `201:INVALID COMMAND USAGE`  | This action is not supported by this command
 * `202:INVALID PARAMETER`      | The format or value of the given parameter value is invalid
 * `203:TIMEOUT`                | The timeout of the currently active command has expired
 * 
 *

 * 
 * ChameleonMini provides eight 'slots' that can be configured to store different virtualized cards, or as active NFC reader, or as completely passive device for sniffing purposes. Each slot stores its configuration and, if applicable, card content. To select a particular slot, use the following command (or configure a button accordingly):
 * Command               | Description
 * --------------------- | -----------
 * `SETTING?`            | Returns the currently activated slot
 * `SETTING=<NUMBER>`    | Sets the active slot, where <NUMBER> is a number between 1 and 8 (see \ref Page_Settings)

 * `FIELD=[0;1]`         | Enables/disables the reader field.
 * 
 * 
 * Timeout Commands \anchor Anchor_TimeoutCommands
 * ----------------
 * Some commands start a process with an unpredictable termination time. In these cases, 
 * ChameleonMini waits with its response, until the result of this process is obtained. In order to prevent an infinite
 * waiting time, an individual timeout value can be set for each slot, in multiples of roughly 100 ms up to 60,000 ms.
 * When a timeout occurs or if a respective command is aborted by means of a setting change, the return code `203:TIMEOUT` is sent and a command-specific shutdown function is called, which terminates the timeout process gracefully.
 * 
 * \warning Any terminal input is completely ignored during the waiting period. 
 * 
 * \warning When setting the timeout to zero, there is no timeout and thus a process may continue forever. 
 * Such a process can only be terminated by changing the setting, if a button is configured accordingly, 
 * or by restarting the ChameleonMini (power off, power on).
 * 
 *
 *
 * Accessing the command-line using a terminal software
 * ====================================================
 * In order to have quick access to the Chameleon's command-line without using any complicated software,
 * we suggest using the [TeraTerm](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) terminal emulation software available for windows based operating systems.
 * 
 * Connecting and setting up
 * -------------------------
 * For establishing a connection to the Chameleon's command line, select File -> New Connection, choose
 * the virtual serial port of the Chameleon and hit the "OK" button. TeraTerm now tries to open the serial port
 * and should succeed without any error.
 *
 * For easier use of the command-line using a terminal software the local-echo functionality should be activated,
 * to be able to see what is typed into the chameleon. When using TeraTerm, this can be achieved by selecting
 * Setup -> Terminal and check "Local Echo".
 *
 * Uploading and Downloading dump files
 * ------------------------------------
 * In some configurations of the Chameleon, it is necessary to upload a card dump before it can be accessed by a reader.
 * For doing so, the relatively simple and widely known XMODEM protocol is used.
 *
 * To upload a dump file using TeraTerm, follow these steps.
 * 1. Enter `UPLOAD` and wait for the `110:WAITING FOR XMODEM` response
 * 2. Select File -> Transfer -> XMODEM -> Send
 * 3. In the dialog choose the binary dumpfile to be uploaded and make sure the option "Checksum" is checked in the lower left corner
 * 4. Hitting the "Open" button will start the transfer. If no error is given to the user, the file has been uploaded sucessfully.
 *
 * To download the Chameleon's memory again, follow the instructions above except for using `DOWNLOAD` instead of `UPLOAD`
 * and the Receive function of TeraTerm
 *
 * Note that there is a 10 second timeout after entering `UPLOAD` respectively `DOWNLOAD`
 * after which the standard command-line is activated again. So try again if the timeout is already
 * over when the XMODEM transfer is about to start.
