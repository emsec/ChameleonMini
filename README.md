Chameleon-Mini
==============
This is the official repository of ChameleonMini, a freely programmable, portable tool for NFC security analysis that can emulate and clone contactless cards, read RFID tags and sniff/log RF data. Thanks to over 1700 backers from our [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1980078555/chameleonmini-a-versatile-nfc-card-emulator-and-mo), the current Revision G has been realized by Kasper & Oswald GmbH.

The ChameleonMini RevG is now also available via the Kasper & Oswald [Webshop](https://shop.kasper.it/). Thank you for supporting the project!
