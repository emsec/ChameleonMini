Chameleon is a versatile emulator for I\-S\-O 14443 contactless smartcards. It is meant to be a programmable platform to assess security aspects in R\-F\-I\-D environments and can be used in different attack scenarios like replay or relay attacks and even for emulating an existing smartcard, thus behaving as a perfect clone of a given card.

The Chameleon Project has been started by the Chair for Embedded Security at the German University in Bochum and has been licensed as open source to let everyone benefit from the work that has been done so far.

We are always looking forward to any means of contributing or contacting us.
