/** @page Page_UploadingDownloading Uploading and Downloading Memory dumps
 * In order to be able to emulate different card contents, one can upload or download
 * the memory used for emulation.
 *
 * The layout of the memory dump depends on the chosen configuration and is usually
 * the same as the memory layout of the currently chosen card-emulation.
 * The size of the memory dump also depends on the currently chosen configuration
 * and can be requested with a specific command on the command-line.
 *
 * In order to upload or download a memory dump, the user has to send the
 * corresponding command on the command-line first and the Chameleon responds
 * with a status message indicating that it is waiting for an X-MODEM connection.
 * Depending on whether upload or download is chosen, the Chameleon then waits
 * for 10 seconds to initiate an X-MODEM receive or send connection.
 *
 * When waiting for a receiving X-MODEM connection, the X-MODEM NAK byte is sent
 * upto 20 times with a delay of 500ms in order to establish
 * a standard 128 byte frame-size X-MODEM connection with the simple checksum scheme.
 * Within this time, the user has to get his X-MODEM client ready and choose the
 * binary file to be uploaded into the memory.
 *
 * In case of waiting for an X-MODEM send connection to establish, a wait time
 * of 10 seconds is performed to receive the X-MODEM NAK byte. Within this time,
 * the user has to start the X-MODEM receiver and set it to the standard 128 byte
 * frame using the simple checksum scheme in order to receive the binary memory dump.
