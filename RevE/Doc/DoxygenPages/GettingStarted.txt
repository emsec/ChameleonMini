 * The first thing you should do is to program the fuse bits and the bootloader 
 * to the Chameleon-Mini.
 * Use your preferred tool to set the fuse bits as follows:
 * 
 * - FUSE1: 0x00
 * - FUSE2: 0xBE
 * - FUSE4: 0xFF
 * - FUSE5: 0xE9
 * 
 * Next, program the appropriate bootloader from the Firmware/Bootloader directory into the chip.
 * The ATxmega chip now automatically enumerates with its DFU bootloader. 
 * Now you can use Atmel's FLIP software or the open source dfu-programmer to program the 
 * Chameleon-Mini.hex/.eep into the FLASH and EEPROM using the bootloader. For this you should
 * follow the instructions of the particular DFU tool.
 * For windows machines, there is an example batch file in the Firmware/Chameleon-Mini directory.
 *
 * Once you have got the Chameleon up and running, it should enumerate as the LUFA CDC device.
 * On windows, you should use the supplied LUFA VirtualSerial.inf in the Drivers folder.
 * When the installation is successful, a new COM port or /dev/ttyS shows up on your system.
 * 
 * This serial port is your means of controlling the Chameleon-Mini from any computer either
 * using a simple terminal emulator, like TeraTerm or your self-crafted scripts and applications.
 *
 * More info on how to use the serial interface can be found here: @ref Page_CommandLine
