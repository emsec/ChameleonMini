 * Chameleon is a versatile emulator for ISO 14443 contactless smartcards.
 * It is meant to be a programmable platform to assess security aspects in
 * RFID environments and can be used in different attack scenarios like replay
 * or relay attacks and even for emulating an existing smartcard,
 * thus behaving as a perfect clone of a given card.
 *
 * The Chameleon Project has been started by the Chair for Embedded Security
 * at the German University in Bochum and has been licensed as open source to
 * let everyone benefit from the work that has been done so far.
 *
 * We are always looking forward to any means of contributing or contacting us.
