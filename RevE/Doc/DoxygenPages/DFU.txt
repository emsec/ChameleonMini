/** @page Page_FirmwareUpgrade Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU)
 * It is possible to upgrade the Firmware using the Atmel DFU Protocol
 * as defined in application note AVR1916. With this possible, there is no need to
 * use any other external programming hardware to upgrade the firmware.
 *
 * The Atmel DFU protocol is supported by Atmel's FLIP software, which also contains
 * `batchisp` and the open source software `dfu-programmer`.
 * In order to flash a new firmware, the device has to be put into DFU mode.
 * To do this, you can either use the command-line by sending the corresponding
 * command or press the button on the device while powering it up.
 *
 * Once the device is in DFU mode, it enumerates as an ATxmegaXYZ USB device and
 * can now be accessed using the above mentioned software tools for erasing,
 * programming and verifying a new firmware HEX file.
 *
 * Depending on what tool you are using for the DFU firmware upgrade,
 * you may have to install the corresponding driver.
 *
 * Note that this procedure can easily be implemented in a command-line script,
 * diminishing the need for user interaction and speeding up the process.
 * The "make dfu-batchisp" or "make dfu-prog" command can be used to program
 * the device using batchisp or dfu-programmer.
 * Note that in both cases, the directory of the tools executables have to exist
 * in the PATH environment variable.
